**Introduction to Image Blending**

Image blending is a technique used to combine two images into one image. It is often used to create a seamless transition between two images. This technique is used in a variety of applications, from digital photography to web design. This can be done by using a variety of methods, such as image masking, image warping, and image composition. Image blending can be used to create interesting effects in photographs, such as adding a special effect to a portrait or creating a surreal landscape. It can also be used to combine two photographs into a single image with a more uniform look. It can also be used to create a montage or collage of images. Image blending
can be used to improve the quality of digital photographs. By blending two images together, flaws in one image can be eliminated or minimized. Image masking is the technique used here for image blending. It involves selecting portions of one image and blending them with the other image. Image masking is a powerful and versatile tool for image editing and manipulation. It is used to selectively reveal or conceal certain parts of an image, allowing for greater control over the final result.
